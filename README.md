# auto-ui-2016
Example of state-of-the-art Automatic UI testing, that benefits the business, is easy to write and maintain, and shows the right bugs in the system under test.
The three goals above, are prioritized, however, if one of the three fail, then none of the others matter.


I am doing this survey or example, since I want to show that it is posible to do value ensuring business scenario validation. 
In my time as developer, teamlead, head of development and product owner, I have seen many kinds of automatic test, and some added great value, and others where just complex.
